    <h3><strong>What Ingredients You Need to Make Homemade Hamburgers</strong></h3>

    <p class="this">The secret to incredibly juicy burger patties is the addition of crushed
        crackers or breadcrumbs to hold in the natural fat and juices.</p>

    <p class="this">We definitely recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed 
       crackers is an old-school method to add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs.
       Plus, it is super handy for using up that package of crackers you have had 
       sitting in the pantry for weeks.</p>
    
    <p class="this">Here is everything you need to make the best homemade hamburger patties:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul class="this">
      <li>Ground chuck. We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
      <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs. The best binders for juicy hamburgers.</li>
      <li>Worcestershire sauce. Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
      <li>Egg. To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
      <li>Milk. The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
      <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol class="this">
       <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, 
          egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.
          Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.</li>
       <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to 
          cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties,
          or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:
          Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a 
          time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. 
          You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they’ll be 
          served on since they will shrink a bit in the cooking process.
          Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent 
          in the center of each patty, so they do not puff up while cooking.
          You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed</li>
       <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 
          350-400 degrees F.
          I love using a cast-iron skillet for getting that drool-worthy caramelized sear
          on the burgers.</li>
       <li>For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a
          medium burger.
          For thin patties: Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.
          Ideally, you only want to flip your burgers once or twice during cooking.</li>
