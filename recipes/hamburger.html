    <h2><strong>What Ingredients You Need to Make Homemade Hamburgers</strong></h2>

    <p>The secret to incredibly juicy burger patties is the addition of crushed
        crackers or breadcrumbs to hold in the natural fat and juices.</p>

    <p>We definitely recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed 
       crackers is an old-school method to add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs.
       Plus, it is super handy for using up that package of crackers you have had 
       sitting in the pantry for weeks.</p>
    
    <p>Here is everything you need to make the best homemade hamburger patties:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground chuck. We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs. The best binders for juicy hamburgers.</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce. Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
        <li>Egg. To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
        <li>Milk. The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>
